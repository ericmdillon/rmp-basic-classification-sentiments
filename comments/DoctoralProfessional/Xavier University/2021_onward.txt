Xavier is what you make it. Join clubs (they're cool and everyone is in them), make friends within your classes because there are so many fun people who have the same interests in you. Professors are kind, engaging, and caring, GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Also social life is fun if you put in just a little effort and go with the flow!
Nursing department is very strong. This school gives you great opportunities and clinical experience. You get a chance to experience many different hospitals in Cincinnati. Overall, tough but strong nursing program.
Food scene is horrible. Few dining options and the cafeteria is poorly managed, and the workers are extremely rude. The only reason they can get away with having bad food and rude workers is because it is the only option for students to eat. If it was a restaurant they would be out of business within the week of opening.
Love it here
Would NEVER recommend the accelerated nursing program at this school. It is disorganized, almost every professor is rude and not willing to help you learn or do better, and the pass rate is incredibly slim due to the lack of support they provide. Save yourself time, money, and your tears and pick another school!!!!!
I heard such great things about Xavier before coming here but now I regret my decision. I will be transferring.
Great school! great access to downtown Cincinnati which is a great young city. Surrounding neighborhood is a bit dicey but the campus police are all brand new and are great.
Great school and you get what you pay for, for the most part. Surrounding area sucks and all the roads are horrible. Campus is great.

Lesley is a pretty decent institution overall. The location is nice, the food is appetizing (not sure why everyone hates it so much), and the facilities are great. The faculty are very accommodating and understanding, and there are many opportunities to build connections. I could do without all the constant virtue signaling, which gets annoying.
The staff and specific classes is the only reason I stayed which for that I am grateful for. Prepare for all your friends to transfer by the end of the year. I read a diff review that talked about admission putting on a happy face when it is orientation and it is TRUE! The only good food served is when you know parents will be there.
I'm not sure if it's because of COVID or it's just the school, but socially there is much left to be desired. The campus is pretty and in a great location, but some of the older buildings could use a lot of work. The best part of Lesley is their programs of study. If your priority is your education, you'll find great professors and decent resources

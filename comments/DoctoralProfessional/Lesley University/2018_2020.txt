Lacks diversity and classes.
Good staff and friendly people.
Lesleys a wonderful school, gives much opportunities. However, the athletic department is not that strong, the facilities are do-able. A place to be if youre mainly there for your major
It may not be perfect, but it's a great school!
Lesley Is a great campus and I think people really take it for granted. Public safety genuinely cares about our well being and for the most part the teachers are great and want to see you do better. The food gets a bad rep, but I don't eat it im a commuter.
fine school if you have a bright outlook. some things are a bit rough around the edges and need to be refined though (like meal plans and housing)
I live on campus and worked close by so I quickly found out that the location wasn't that great. On top of that there is very little to do and if you don't have a car or work for bus/train fair then you aren't getting anywhere good. Its really hard to find out what clubs are available as well, after 4 years I still have no idea. The staff is meh.
I love Lesley and couldn't be happier. Professors and staff members are very willing to help you find career opportunities that work for you. The food is generally hit or miss. Main common buildings and newer dorms are nice. The old dorm buildings are pretty, but not recommended- I had a bug infestation last year and exterminators couldn't fix it.
Lesley High
Lesley is a clinically fine school. If you're looking to get your degree and have little interest in engaging internships or a comfortable school culture then this is you're school. If you're looking for a good social scene and happy students, I'd look a bit further.
Not the popular kids haha. Barely any boys. Very accepting. Sports are not popular or followed by students. No athletic facilities other than exercise facilities. Well-sized dorm rooms. Maintenance and cleaning leaves much to be desired.

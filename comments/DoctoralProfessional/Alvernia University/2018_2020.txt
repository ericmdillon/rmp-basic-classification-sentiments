I loved it here since my first tour. Even though its small, a lot of strong connections are made. A smaller number of professors means you will most likely have them more than once so you learn how they grade and their teaching style
Alvernia is a great school with great faculty. Like any other school, there are issues, however, the environment and atmosphere was a perfect fit for me.
Completed undergraduate degree as a transfer and lived 1 year on campus and the last year rented a residential apartment and commuted. Last year was more cost effective for living expenses. Seems like campus food is still an issue. Completed graduate degree in online program. Quality education with well-respected professors in the business dept
I loved Alvernia when I went on my tour. Went to school there... totally different story. No one cares about getting an education or learning there. I went to office hours and even got a response of I have no idea how to help you one biology degree later.. learned nothing, made about 2 friends, and met a lot of rude people. Also 112,000 in debt.
I love this college. Everyone is so welcoming and always around if you need help. There are plenty of activities to do around campus and a bunch of free trips off campus. I never had a problem with any professor.
it's ok here. Not the best but not the worst.
The DPT program here is god awful. The professors are absolutely trash, there is no communication, they are hypocritical, and there is no set standard. Its just a huge mess.
Alvernia was the second college Ive attended for my college education. I started out in community college and wanted to finish up my bachelors. This school has given me so many opportunities and is highly helpful in finding the students the resources they need to be successful. Needless to say I will be starting grad school next year!

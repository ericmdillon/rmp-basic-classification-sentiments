I came to this school for the people. Making friends here is not difficult and everyone is generally nice and welcoming. COVID changes the regular college . The worst thing that Alvernia has done in relation to COVID policy is having tents. I have two of my classes in a tent and it is not fun. We are also not allowed to go to other peoples rooms.
The school is very small and is the equivalent to a highschool when it comes to social life. Students are very immature and petty and there was a lot of drama and parties on campus. The campus didnt care for covid regulations either it was like a free for all and communication from staff is horrible. Save your money and go else where.
Food is awful
Im not sure how anyone can give food anything other than a 1
I love it here! Of course this school has its problems as every school does but overall its great. The activities on campus and trips are always so fun and the people here are great. For the most part the professors are all amazing and super nice. Its small but I like it that way.
Terrible, no activities, food is horrific, dorms have mold in them, was sick the whole semester, no parties or anything to do in reading. Super boring. Lots of drama within the student body, much like an extension of highschool.

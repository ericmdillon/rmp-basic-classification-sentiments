UCA is what you make of it. You can choose to sit in your dorm room all day but there is always opportunities and chances to be social--even during the pandemic. Also, as a transfer student UCA is costly and we pay unnecessary fees . You should save and go to a community college first for core classes and then transfer to mitigate costs.
UCA is a beautiful campus. The library is nice and housing is either good or really bad. As a transfer student, it was difficult to get acclimated, especially socially. As a vegetarian, food choices are slim. In the bio & chem deps., I respected very few professors, LSC is disgusting, and class choices are a joke. The president is only about $$.
Consider this an online school at this point. Professors don't care. Faculty isn't helpful. Professors will NOT follow their class schedule whatsoever. Communication has been terrible. The online experience is horrendous. The campus itself is beautiful, you just won't be able to make use of it until they open up.
I'm a transfer student and I've had trouble getting my credits transferred. You must stay on top of your academic advisor or you will end up taking more classes than you need. You can tell they are all about the money, so if they can get over on you they will.
UCA has a great campus and for the most part it is very nicely decorated. It is in a pretty alright location, there is plenty of food places and some things to do. The food could be improved and of course some places need a good makeover. I wish clubs did more than they do.
ok
love it here
UCA is a beautiful campus! But that's about it. A very select few professors are helpful, otherwise you will just get neglected. If you are here for Greek life or sports then you are in for a great social experience at UCA! If not, you better find friends because clubs are hard to find and be a part of.
It's cool. You will meet a lot of people here.

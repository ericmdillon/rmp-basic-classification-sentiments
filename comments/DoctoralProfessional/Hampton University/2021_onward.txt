Gross school, insane expectations. No pajamas are allowed to be worn outside of your room until after 11pm. No bonnets, durags, or baseball hats allowed either. Mandatory room checks
Campus is very pretty on the outside. The cafe is VERY hit or miss. Few dorms need renovating, most are nice with typical problems. Get involved early to know about opportunities! Most students are very helpful and there is a good sense of community. There's not much to do in walking distance (no car first two years) but PTC isn't far by shuttle.
Most of the professors are rude and not much help at all outside of class. Not very welcoming or helpful with important questions and information
Dont come here.
This school is not what I expected.
I would not recommend this school to anyone. If I could do it over again I would have chose a better school. They are very old school and stuck in their ways. Most things are cliquish and high school like. The food is very bad as well as the living conditions. I can not wait to transfer
I would not recommend this institution to anyone. Please do not attend, you would be doing yourself a huge service by picking another school. Personally I cant wait to transfer.
I cant think of one thing good about this school. The school rather spend money on statues while dorms have old molded water fountains, mold infested rooms, and trashy internet. The food is horrible. Most professors do not want to see you win. Everything is outdated included the faculty and staff. They have so many rules for adults. Dont come.

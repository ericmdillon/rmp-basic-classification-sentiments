This school is a joke.
I really liked my time here, private university and small classes meant it was easy to get 1 on 1 help. Science dept staff is great. I loved the ballston campus, easy commute/great neighborhood. Another person said the area is sketchy? It's in one of the wealthiest areas in the U.S and very safe? As a small girl I always felt safe here, not scared.
Beautiful campus - The university has several building spread out across the City of Arlington.
Great for a small school!
A wonderful university that is filled with opportunity. This university makes you feel as if you are part of a family.

The food gets worse and worse every year, There is one meal for lunch and dinner and that one meal can be very spotty at times. Its either the one meal that changes daily or Mac and cheese or pizza or even M&C on the pizza I would say once maybe twice a week the food is edible. Would not recommend relying on the university for food.
Marymount is the definition of a middle-child school. There are some good redeeming qualities, and others that are the most frustrating thing you'll ever deal with. Atmosphere and people are great, however the way the school is run is not the best.
You have to make the most of what Marymount offers you. If you join a team or a club you can make really good friends but if not, there's not much to do. A
I regret ever attending Marymount. The school has so many problems I can't even begin to list all of them. The financial departments are incompetent, which you think would be necessary for the school to function. I have been struggling for months to even have a conversation with them on money that has been paid but not showing on my account.

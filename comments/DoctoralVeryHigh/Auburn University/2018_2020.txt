Social is a 3 because I am not involved in extracurriculars. I do not have any time in my schedule to do so & if you're not involved there are not that many chances to make friends. Safety as of lately has been questionable. Everything else is amazing, I love it here.
I'm from out of state and coming to Auburn was the best decision I have ever made. wde
* The football culture is world-class. Fall semester is best semester, for sure. * Clubs are HUGE on campus, but not mandatory. Finding one you like is never hard. * Strictly on-campus, food can be hit or miss. You might find yourself walking downtown for better meals (A short walk). * Most students have cars, but it's not necessary. Bike share.
Its the best
Love the campus and the atmosphere. This college is tough when it comes to engineering, nursing, architecture... the big majors. However, it is the most artistic school I've seen. Come prepared to spend some money and deal with work, hard work.
Overall pretty decent; limited food selection and internet is definitely extremely poor/limited at times. Besides this, I have no major complaints.
Auburn has been greedy as of late- accepting more students into the university each year, and reducing living and parking space for more college buildings makes the population density go up with each semester. Poor internet, long lines, competition for opportunities- this is one case where talking about "the good old days" isn't an exaggeration.
Auburn builds athletic facilities before parking, accepts more students every year but does very little to accommodate the ones they have. The entire school seems to revolve around athletics and not the students who go there. This is very obvious when it comes to limited dining choices, 0 parking, its hard to find somewhere to sit even after class.
Nice college.
Even while studying abroad I couldn't stop talking about how much I love Auburn
Auburn is a great school with just about any major you can think of. Also, it's not as easy to get an A as you may think. Some teachers are great and some are horrible. Be prepared to work hard. On the other hand, campus is beautiful and has a warm vibe to it. All of the sports, except football, are free admission for students, so don't miss out.
Having a degree from Auburn should be something you are proud of. My time here was the best years of my life. Auburn might not be the easiest school but the benefits it gives you is worth it. The Auburn family is real and theres no place else you'd rather want to call home. War Eagle!!
I love this school!
Auburn is a family University. They expect a lot of their students. Registration is a bit of a struggle. Big majors like engineering, pre med, and architecture, requires a lot of work. Auburn wants their students to be ready by giving you hard classes. We only believe in work, hard work! The atmosphere is amazing you will have tons of fun!
BEST COLLEGE EVER. Campus facilities are top notch and community environment is supernatural. THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE.
If you love the small town feel, but a place where there is always something going on and fun things to do, Auburn is the place for you!! We work hard and play hard
Auburn is easily the best College ever. Football games are fun, campus is really nice, and everyone is really friendly. Best home on the plains
War Eagle Forever.
I LOVE AUBURN! War Eagle
Love Auburn University. War Eagle ����
Located in the middle of no where. Auburn is a good school if you chose the right major. I had a bad experience, but that doesnt reflect everyone elses! There are like 4 bars downtown, and not much else for the night life. The cafeteria food is lacking! Do not recommend. This campus is very safe. Good internet connection, terrible parking setup.
I have enjoyed every minute of Auburn.
Auburn University is the place to be. Between the southern hospitality, traditions, and the Auburn Spirit, you always know where to call home. At Auburn, your mind can rest at ease knowing that you are getting the top education in the state of Auburn (often compared to schools such as Harvard and Yale, War Eagle!),with name recognition over borders
Stellar Engineering schools, good football culture. On-campus food is hit or miss due to changing owners/names/menus. Campus is easy to get to on foot, but most major shopping is car distance (or Friday-only shopping transit). Social events are everywhere, plenty of frats/sororities and clubs to pick from. People here are pretty nice.
I wish I could make everyone I know at least tour Auburn. It is a truly magical place and I will miss it so much when I leave after a Bachelor and a Master's degree! Its super diverse & there are 1 mil. ways to feel involved. Only complaint is no parking (get an apartment near campus and walk!!) and then the food is super tasty but too expensive!
Auburn is the place I've felt safest literally ever, and the population is incredible. Friendly, healthy, and motivating
Auburn is the best school you could attend.
I loved every bit of Auburn
So sad that I've got to leave soon. Even though classes can get extremely tough, I've had the best time times of my life here and consider this home.
Great!
!War Eagle!
Auburn has so many opportunities to gain leadership experience that is applicable in the real world. All of my professors have been so ready and willing to help me, I have never felt like my job search was a one person job. I have continually felt supported by the staff and have found lifelong friends. War Eagle forever.
Education: The curriculum is very relevant , the professors are well qualified and supportive. Facilities: The campus is lush and plenty of resources. The Recreational Center is state of the art. Location: Auburn is a small town in a rustic set up and not many major attractions to visit near by.
I think the way the city was built around this campus is amazing. You can obviously tell it is a college town and the spirit is crazy!
The best University in the South- hands down.
Do you enjoy driving in circles for 30 minutes on an average Tuesday JUST to find a parking spot at the library? Then THIS is the school for you!!! But be warned, there is only one library for 25,000 students, so even if you win the ruthless mad max competition for one of about 200 parking spots, you won't find a table soon. This is EVERY night.
Auburn University just feels like a family, which distinguishes it from the rest. I've heard it called "the smallest large school in America" because of the environment. Auburn is a college town, so the university rules the city and surrounding areas. Great location: only 1.5 hours from Atlanta and 2.5 hours from Birmingham.
A family. People are impressed everywhere I go.
Auburn is a larger school but has a small feel. Most everyone is involved on campus. There have been many networking and career building opportunities so far in my college journey. As well as a small(ish) school feel and excellent networking the faculty for the most part is phenomenal, especially in the College of Ag. War Eagle!!
Auburn University is full of big city opportunity while also maintaining its unique small town vibe that makes going to school here feel like gaining another hometown.
Great place to study. gamedays are so much fun. Just gotta make sure go out of your way to meet new people. Not much to do on the weekends except drink, and if you don't like that it's kind of difficult
Auburn is an awesome school. There are endless opportunities here and everyone is so nice!
War Eagle! I love this school and even though it's challenging, I feel like I am getting my best possible education.
Auburn is the college for everyone. Nice little town centered around the university. Football games are fun and exciting. Traffic is annoying after football games at regular rush hours of the day. Not enough parking for students or visiting guests. Very hard working college with Extremely high expectations. MANY connection. Students are adored!!!!
Auburn has pros and cons. Pros: beautiful campus, great education, awesome alumni network, ability to be social outside of greek life. Fantastic academically. Cons: diverse? hah, no. Nothing to do unless you still want to binge drink or drive to Atlanta for activities. Very southern in terms of societal expectations. Excited to get out with degree.
Auburn is a very academically challenging school. However, that is why Auburn is so distinguished. Auburn is a very charming school but the closest thing to it is Atlanta. As for happiness here, the Auburn family is something special and no matter how bad my classes are, I never want to leave.
Stunning campus, friendly students and staff who (for the most part) actually care. The only downside to this school is that it's exceedingly hard if you're going for a more science based degree; depending on what professor you get, even the simplest subject is a nightmare. You won't survive here unless you learn to make friends and group study!
Coming from a major city, Auburn can seem very small but I truly enjoy the campus and city. Most of the professors are very caring and kind, and I haven't had any issues dealing with the university. Their Accommodations Office is 10/10. Sororities are a lot cheaper and more low-key here. Not many bars/frat parties but there's always things to do
great place
Love Auburn! The campus is beautiful the professional development and network here is amazing. As for social life, get out of your comfort zone and really work hard to meet as many people as you can. Everyone is so friendly. War Eagle!
Auburn is great
It's got it's strength and weaknesses. Overall a meh school, could be a lot better but not that bad
Auburn definitely gets a lot better reputation than it actually is. It's got all the basics you need for college and differently could be a lot worse, but if only have heard good thing about this school, prepare to be disappointed.
Auburn isn't a party school, but you KNOW that coming in to it. I chose auburn for a reason - it's a wonderful place with great people.
Auburn is a beautiful campus with great professors, for the most part. If you are an AG student, be prepared to walk across campus to get food or be prepared to buy lunch off-campus every day. I have enjoyed my years at Auburn and love my Auburn family.
The best college ever!
Best school with the friendliest people around, students and staff.
Auburn is an excellent school and I have had nothing but great experiences with professors and opportunity. However, I hate that it is located in the middle of nowhere.
Auburn has become a cross between SJWs and excessive spending/underimpressive sports. Most teachers act too busy to help, and have such poor teaching skills you require dozens of hours of supplemental instruction just to make sense of it all. They rush through the material, and overall try to discourage you from certain programs if you need help.
Love it here, only complaint is the food and a couple crappy buildings.
Auburn was the best decision I've ever made. I love it here, and I feel as though I am receiving a quality education. Tuition is pricey for out-of-state students; however, a great value for the degree.
Auburn is an amazing University surrounded by a nice, small town. They really emphasize doing more than just getting good grades, and really push you to get involved. Greek Life is big here, which may or may not be a good thing depending on who you are. On campus dining leaves something to be desired, though it isn't awful.
Auburn is a fun place to be, but they do often overwhelm you with classes. I would suggest that if you have a difficult major to do less clubs and activities (i.e. 1 club p sem, 2 activities p sem) because my first semester I drowned because I was too involved and couldn't properly manage my time in a way that I studied enough. War eagle though.
In my 4 years, Auburn has changed significantly. It gets more dining options, new buildings, and better resources each year. Has the best tiny college town feel, but the campus is vast. Easy to have tight relationships w teachers, who want you to succeed. Classes can be as small as 7 people, or as large as 300. Favorite place on Earth.
War Eagle, find your niche and the Auburn Family will treat you right.
Still has a long way to go in terms of diversity and inclusion, but overall a fun and well-respected campus in the southeast
I love it here. Everything is amazing. There are tons of things to do and you are super close to other places if you do not want to do anything in Auburn. 10/10 recommend.
No one has an environment or spirit quite like Auburn's which has a rich history full of tradition.
I started at AU nine years after high school. Being an older student, I feel like I was more able to appreciate what AUs Campus had to offer. From the new state-of-the-art facilities to all the restaurants and food trucks. Its a beautiful campus. I wish theyd chill w/ all the new construction. They have new construction sites everywhere.
Auburn is home. Everyone feels like family here, and I have never felt unsafe on campus
I came here as a transfer student and had to spend a few semesters adjusting to university life but at the end of the day, i made it. The people have their own cliques so it is pretty hard for an introvert like me to make friends or have a social life. The faculty definitely does a good job of challenging you and preparing you for life.
This is a beautiful campus in the deep south. The university is a R1 research university with many excellent degree programs. The school has a great sports program to balance the high academic programs.
War Eagle always!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The BEST college experience that you can ask for! There is truly a sense of Auburn Family from the time you accept the enrollment to years after graduation. The town was recently added to one of the best retirement towns in the South by Southern Living Magazine. It truly is the loveliest village on the Plains!
Amazing school. War Eagle.
Auburn is the best place on the earth
Dope
I have had a wonderful time here and I find it very hard to complain. The professors, for sure in the business school, want you to succeed and will help you in every way. They provide you with a ton of networking connections and opportunities. There is never a dull moment here. If you are unsure, choose Auburn. WAR EAGLE!
Greek culture kind of dominates. Diversity is pretty lacking
This university is one of the best in the country!
Amazing university with anything you could need or want
Its a great place
Great school. Atmosphere is inclusive and homey. It makes you feel like you are where you belong.
I love AU but at the same time things can be challenging but its totally worth it. Food can be an issue having to wait 30-35 mins to get lunch that not a food truck outside.
Auburn is amazing. The best university in the South. But life tip: DONT TAKE MATH HERE. If you obey that one rule, youll believe in Auburn. And love it!
It's a great school that I really enjoyed!
Amazing school from spirit to education, beautiful campus and great athletics, what more is there to offer, also very social school with great greek life.
Great school with a great reputation and football team. I just wish there were fewer sororities & fraternities cause they took the fun out of it. overall I have mixed feelings 3/5
I love it!
its not as good as I thought it would be
Expect no help on anything from any of the services "provided" by Auburn University. They do not care about students they only care about keeping you here and paying tuition.
Auburn University is such an amazing school. The city itself is so friendly and warm feeling. I only live three hours from home and I never leave Auburn. I've stayed in Auburn the past three summers because I love it so much.
Its dope
Love auburn. Great school, great professors. War Eagle!!!
I've fallen in love with Auburn! Campus is nice. Sports and Greek life are vibrant and it's easy to get involved socially. Diversity is lacking and it's mostly conservative white Southerners, but don't let that stop you if you don't fit that mold. The engineering school is great and clubs and opportunities abound. Would recommend... war eagle!!
I LOVE THIS SCHOOL. Literally nothing else like Auburn university. I've lived a lot of places and this is by far the best place i've been. This town will always be special to me now. If you have the chance to go here, you will NOT regret it.
Great school
Auburn is great. Keep an eye out for bikes, skateboards, etc.. I will always be an Auburn man.
Out of state student, overall well welcoming school
I LOVE AUBURN UNIVERSITY!! WAR EAGLE!!
The happiest campus I have ever seen. I believe in Auburn and love it. War Eagle!
Food could be better
War Eagle! Amazing place for a great education.
I feel like I wasted four years of my life and came out dumber than I started.
Roll Tide
This is the best school to go to if you cherish tradition, location, greek life, and a good education. Excellent networking opportunities as well.
Prepare to be nothing if you aren't involved with Greek life. You will be ignored and be merely a shadow. Auburn is a good school, but it is so far from everything you will feel like you are in the middle of nowhere. I wish more emphasis would be put on education rather than social life and partying. You have been warned.
Its so homie!
Auburn is amazing! They care about their students, and their food is amazing. Also, you literally feel like family as soon as you step on campus! Go here! I promise you will love it!
Auburn is such a special place. Im so thankful for my opportunity to go to school there, as well as the opportunities afforded to me by my Auburn education. War Eagle!
WAR EAGLE BEST DECISION EVER MADE.
I came to AU from California. I thought it'd be too good to be true- what Auburn advertises is that it's a home and a family. As a student, this is exactly what Auburn has been for me. I could not recommend this school more; I absolutely adore it and feel supported in every way. Easily the best decision I have ever made. It truly is a family. WDE!
WAR DAMN EAGLE!! I love Auburn so much! Such a friendly and quant campus/town! Im so glad I chose to attend AU!
WDE! Best years of your life
The only thing I would want is different/more restaurants/food. Sometimes hard to get something to eat between classes but the campus and everything else is AMAZING.
War Eagle! Choosing to attend Auburn University was one of the best decisions I've ever made!
i love this school
I believe in Auburn and love it <3
Loveliest village
WAR EAGLE always. Auburn is the superior school
I love the energy the school brings. You are given tons of opportunities to make friends and meet new people. The campus is always clean and feels safe even at night. The advisors are super helpful and the majority of professors are amazing. There is a place for everyone here. I also love the food trucks and new places to eat on campus.
Loveliest Village on the plains.. need I say more?
It is a wretched hive of evil and villainy.
They say that Disney is the happiest place on Earth... well they lied. WDE.
An excellent school that makes you feel like a part of a family. Beautiful campus and town that has plenty to do and lots of opportunities for you to get involved. Parking is atrocious, but that's to be expected with any big college.
Beautiful place, friendly people, feels like home.
Super conservative. Boring town. Just blah overall.
I fell in love with Auburn as soon as I stepped on campus. Auburn not only has the best campus, but is a great little town as well. People are friendly, buildings are beautiful, and food is delicious. Most importantly, if you're looking for a quality education, professors that care about you, and friends that will last a lifetime, go to Auburn.
After first semester I am already screwed out of being accepted into my chosen major because of how fundamentally flawed the grading systems are, I was screwed out of a high b for a 79 instead in public speaking due to losing 23 points in whole for exceeding the time limit in two of my five speeches. Yet they say it prepares you for the real world

Love here!!
It's a good student and I have had a lot of great opportunities here. I have made a lot of friends from all over the world. I really like UK and the professors seem to care about students well being
Great school.
I think the way UK handled the pandemic can be considered as better than what other campuses have done. They did a great job accommodating freshmen and helping us adapt to a college setting in a global pandemic, and I've been able to experience college life almost as if it's a regular school year. Found great communities and I really like it here!
Its nice
Beautiful campus - with nearly all living facilities recently built. Greek system is robust and active; sports teams are usually good and worth rooting for. Enrollment is growing; passed 30,000 in Fall 2019 and 31,000 in Fall 2020; so UK is a growing dynamic campus. Featured majors are medical fields, engineering, business and equine science.
Greek life is a huge part of this school and where most people find their friend groups. The professors are great but some do seem to act very high and mighty. Between clubs/greek life, sporting events, the bar scene, keneland, and studying on campus or off campus, my schedule is always full. Live on north campus. Great location and things to do!
Overall loving it here!
I am a student in the Engineering program and have loved every second of my time here. The professors are extremely competent and passionate. UK also has one of the most beautiful campuses I've ever seen. They are constantly updating buildings and adding amenities to make life here better. They also have the nicest dorms ever so that's a hugs plus.
its cool
UK blows as a school all together, they don't care at all about students and student life on campus. They act like they have all these fun events but they suck. They're perfectly happy with every student depressed in their dorms all day. If you're looking for a fun college experience, go to a wet campus.
For the most part, UK is a great campus and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Lexington is a great city and has some great food off/around campus. On campus, the food could use a serious upgrade. It's not terrible all of the time, but there are very little healthy options on campus, you're pretty much limited to Chick-fil-A and Papa John's.
Love campus but didn't know we were number 10 in the nation for assault cases against women... so ladies carry your tasers.
i love UK. is like its own little city
the BEST college ever
The 90 and Champs are kinda hit-or-miss sometimes, but there is a decent selection of restaurants. Central/South campus is quieter/safer than North campus. The campus is a couple of miles from downtown Lexington, and it's a short drive from almost anywhere else important. Really beautiful campus overall.
I loved my time at UK so much, I went back for grad school ��
I adore UK and wish I could stay forever. Lexington is a charming city, the faculty really cares, and the dorms are very nice. It is everything high school me wished college would be. They are also extremely accommodating for all sorts of disabilties.
I really like its central location but it just seems the professors are way more focused on research than students.
glad I picked UK!
Love UK! But have to make sure you go out of your way to meet new people.
Love it here. It's easier to make a big campus feel small than a big one feel large.
University of Kentucky is a beautiful campus. it is really hit or miss when it comes to the profs. Some want you to succeed, and some want you to fail. It is hard to make friends especially if you choose not to take part in greek life. I am happy with my choice to come here, but I do wish some things were just a little bit different
Your experience at UK is truly what you make of it. Try to get involved as much as possible on campus because it will probably be your best bet on making friends. Food is good, buildings are very nice, dorms are awesome too (definitely try living on campus-- north campus is really nice). The internet, however, is awful. So, be mindful of that lol
good school, would be better when covid regulations are gone
You'd better hope nothing bad happens to you, because the offices meant to help you are simply for show. They are absolutely useless. This was my dream school and the only reason I am not transferring is because my major is not available much elsewhere. If you do not do an LLP (or honestly, join Greek Life) you will not find connections.
Everything about this school is awful. Do not go to this school unless you are paying in-state or have a scholarship.
Good School. Would recommend. It is really what you make of it.
Great school. Wifi across campus is a hit or miss all the time. Safety isn't the best but it is made up for in dorms and amenities, which are abundant and very nice.
I love it here!
Good campus and very nice people.
has good bone but you gotta learn how to navigate life here
Its not the best, not the worst.
I have made zero friends in my 4 years here despite reaching out to people in my classes every semester. If you aren't interested in drinking or Greek life, it's definitely more difficult to make friends. Overall the campus is pretty, but Lexington gets really boring after awhile. If you are social this will be a good school for you.
I am an out-of-state student, who did not receive the bluegrass scholarship due to unfair circumstances, and I wholeheartedly feel that I wasted my money here. $50K a year just to have to deal with the scummiest, most artificial people and professors. Everyone is narcissistic and unkind. I felt like an outcast my whole time here and I regret UK.
If you want to spend all of your time alone in your dorm with no friends(even though you have literally tried everything)this is the place for you. Everyone already has friends because they are local. There are no fun clubs and classes suck. Every boy here is a misogynist and every girl here is a pick me. Pick a different school for your own good!
Wonderful atmosphere for graduate students.
the campus is very nice! but beware of certain teachers, they will screw you over if they get the chance
Cost of attendance is pretty high, but the school is worth it in my opinion.
UK definitely has great facilities- the dorms in particular are excellent. The dining halls usually have pretty good food (for a college campus at least). I've never felt unsafe on campus (though I don't go to parties). However, it is a big campus so its important to join clubs/talk with people in classes to make friends.
If you like to play sports at home, do not go here. The campus has no good areas to do anything. The clubs are very limited and suck. If you want to play catch there are only two places to go the front and back of willy t. do not go here you are gonna feel like you are trapped.
The campus is gorgeous and I find myself walking around outside most days. The campus is right downtown so you are around many diverse spots around lexington. The food is pretty good for a campus and I have a lot of options even with my allergies. I feel really safe here- although I don't go to parties so I can't speak on that. Overall I love it.
UK is very close to Lexington so there are a lot of opportunities for fun to be had! That also makes it so that there are people who are not UK students to sometimes be on campus, but generally they are nice people and just looking to have a good time! Go Cats!
I love this university
Love Lexington , campus is great

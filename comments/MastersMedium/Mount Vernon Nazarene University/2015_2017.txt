Private colleges are known for their outdated dorms, small classes, and more of a one-on-one connection. All of these are correct pertaining to  Mount Vernon Naz. The gym is ity bity, the dorms are  internally not appealing, and the food could be better. But it was the perfect place for my first year of college.
I hate this place. I chose it because of the small class sizes but the professors still don't take the time to get to know you. The classes you take are pretty pointless. the food and internet suck! There is nothing to do. YOU ARE JOINING A CULT AND CAN NOT HAVE MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!
Its a great small campus, Christian environment.
I enjoy going to this school, it has its upsides and downsides like anywhere else.
Times have been tough.  Some professors are passionate about teaching and make sure you understand the content.  While others, are uninterested to teach and the class is crammed into your head because that that's how it's "meant to be".   These private credits do not transfer easy, so i've been stuck.  If only I knew then, what I know now.
Good, not great. I would transfer as a sophomore if I had to do it over.
This place very quickly became my home. Like anywhere else, college is what you make of it. I have some of the best relationships with my professors and fellow students. The community of Mount Vernon, Ohio is so welcoming and loving of the Naz students, and I enjoy supporting their local businesses and creating relationships that will last.
Great workers but food can be left out for awhile and still given to us.

They will provide plenty financial aid during freshman year, but afterwards will not award even a fraction of that amount. Many classes can't be transferred to another school, so you are almost "stuck" there.
There is no job placement program here. After you are out, you're pretty much on your own.
Lots of rules but nice school.
It's a school of opportunity. If you want to travel often, see the world, get connected with internships, and change the world, they offer the freedom to do so. If you want to sit around and barely get by, its possible. It's all what you make it.
MVNU is a great school with high standards and expectations. If you want to be more than a number, go to this university. Outstanding president with amazing ideas and initiative. Many of the professors are talented and want every student to succeed. This is a university that can change your life.

Excellent people and great things happening. The art department (facility and faculty) is top notch.

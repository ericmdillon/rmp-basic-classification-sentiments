Wonderful community feel!
The staff and faculty are second to none. They care so much, are always available, and half of them even invite students over for dinner. It's really unique how devoted they are to making sure we're successful. Education is excellent, with the exception of a few gen eds. We're in a cornfield, but not too far from Columbus. Housing needs updated.
The Professors really care about the students and try to get to know you. Ive had lunch with many of the faculty and they genuinely want to make the university a better place. The students as a whole are very friendly people if you want to make friends youll have plenty in no time. Overall great small school atmosphere with a close nit community.
Food is never consistent and they always try to get fancy with creations and fail instead of just making normal day food better. You HAVE to have Ethernet in order for Wifi to work for you unless you are on mobile.
Not much to do in town, but the people are great.
Good campus, but not much to do at night because its a Christian campus.
The faculty/staff is disrespectful, and does not care about students. I have been bullied, and harassed from the month I moved on campus my freshman year. The campus itself is not an awful place, enough to do to stay busy, small, and if you make good friends and stick to them you'll be okay. I am dropping out my senior year and going somewhere else
Food is tolerable. People are nice, but only because they have to be at a Christian University. There is nothing to do outside of campus unless you travel an hour away to Columbus. Better hope you have a creative mind!
The faculty and staff are so friendly and really want to see you succeed. Location can be fun, if you're adventurous.
Join CoSMO groups! Best experience!
It's pretty cool

They have done a really good job in the mining department for helping me get internships. Since Covid happened the food situation has gotten worse but I have high hopes it will be back up and running here soon. All in all great college nothing bad to say about it.
They waste no time getting it into your head that you're going to be working hard just to end up at a desk job for 45 years and you will never do any hands-on work after graduating. Transferring out, but as a hiker, I'm gonna miss the Black Hills. Was also nice to have an on-campus gym and two libraries in biking distance. Great weather for SD, too
This school prides itself on freshman and sophomore "weed out courses" that give it an incredibly high drop-out rate. Tenured profs often have students reading textbooks rather than lecturing. Creepy people often roaming campus. School acts like it cares about student's mental health, but has repeatedly shown that it could not care less.
School has a reputation for being difficult so what can you expect? Well, most of the material really isn't too hard but professors for harder classes are just awful. TIPS if you do come: Join a club, Make your own food, Get out the dorms 3rd year, Read your books, Make a schedule. If I could go back, would not even think of coming here.
Mines is a fun and interactive place to be. The food isn't all that bad, it's just repetitive. The area is beautiful and the classes are challenging.
I never heard of South Dakota Mines when I was getting recruited to play football there, but once I visited the campus and meet with the faculty I knew I had to go here! The campus is beautiful, the education is top tier, you will leave this school a well rounded engineer! I really loved my time at SD Mines, Hardrocker for life!!

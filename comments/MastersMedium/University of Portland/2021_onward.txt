this school demands far too much of it's students. i have to take 17-19 credits each semester just to be able to graduate in four years. that is way too much for any person to retain sanity. do not go here unless all you like to do is study. that's all you have time to do. never related to c's get degrees more.
I like it here, the people are super nice, the campus is pretty, and the classes are interesting
Overall, a very nice liberal arts school in a great location.
Beautiful campus, amazing professors, wonderful staff, and an extraordinary athletic division. I have no complaints except for one big one... the internet. This school spends so much on its' lawns and gardens that I don't think there is any room left for making the wifi functional even 50% of the time. For such high tuition, the wifi sucks.
not great with diversity, equity, and inclusion and has a lot of issues to tackle with sexual assault. located at the very edge of portland.
Great small school
pretty campus

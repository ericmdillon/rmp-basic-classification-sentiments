The school is fun but most of the people make it so you don't want to be there anymore. But it's just who you hang around. The food is good until it feels like you eating the something everyday. For the surroundings of the school, it's on a dangerous road but not too dangerous. Just don't be out late late.
Honestly, I would not go here if I had another choice. I had an awful experience as a new student and that hasn't changed throughout the years. It seems like every semester there is an armed robbery or assault. Not much school spirit. I had a friend living in the campus apartments and her door wouldn't stay shut and there was mold. No fixes.
If you want to get a degree your at the right place. If you want to get a degree you can actually use, look elsewhere. They are focused on students and numbers. Academics and what you will really need after is definitely not provided. Well not to all! Become a student leader and face and your in there. Debt consumed will not equal to your pay.

Campus is quiet and small I don't mind it. Many clubs and sororities to join, very athletic school. Professors so far are super lientiet and nice. The people I have met are even more nice. I compare my professors to my friends professors to other schools and Caldwell has very nice professors. Small classes too I love it you get one on one time.
I really love coming here. Everyone knows everyone and it's like a small community.

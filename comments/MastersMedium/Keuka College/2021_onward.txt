Mediocre at best. Lots of unresolved issues and most of the staff could care less about you. Professors are pretty good though. Food is disgusting and makes everyone sick. Should not be anyone's first choice. Everyone I know wishes they went somewhere else, including me.
School is in the middle of no where, none of the staff or facility help their own students and much less the out of state students. ADA coordinator is ableist and an awful person. The food on campus is the worst except in the Wolf Den. Dorms and lounges need much needed makeovers. Students are always expressing their want on leaving the college.
This place has an all around high school feel. So much drama and very immature students and activities. Also in the middle of nowhere, have to drive at least 30 minutes to get anywhere other than a drugstore or McDonalds. Staff is super unhelpful. Can't believe I lasted a full semester at this place before transferring.
Don't waste your time or money. Plenty of better, more affordable schools that have much farther reach than Keuka.
Food sucks. They blocked netflix and hulu on the wifi. Dorms are outdates as hell. The lake is pretty. Parking is terrible. Do you want to get $150 in parking tickets? Then come to Keuka college. Mustang pub 10/10 recommend.

ODU is a great school if you are looking for a place that is small and homey! I love the help that I have received here academically.I really love the Biology program! ODU is not really a party school. ODU's facilities and branding could use some help, but that seems like an issue in the universities' leadership.
Would not go here
Even though I had to quit my field due to illness, I am glad I went to ODU. I had more field placements than most university students can dream of. The "real life" experiences learning at my field placements and the small class sizes gave me real world learning I needed. Even though ODU is a small campus, I was always meeting new people.

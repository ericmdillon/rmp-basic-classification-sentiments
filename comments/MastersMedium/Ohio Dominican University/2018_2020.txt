Columbus, Ohio is currently the 14th largest city in the United States. Ohio Dominican University is a tiny, secluded Catholic school that is overshadowed by "The" OSU, Capital, and even Old Dominion University (which isn't even in Ohio). However, this small school has immense opportunity: studying abroad, leadership, internships, and friends.
New Chefs have improved the food here immensely so now it is actually enjoyable to eat here. There are many opportunities for jobs and internships during and after college through the career center. Social activities are always fun to attend and they send out emails daily of things you can do on campus! Very happy with my college choice!
At Odu your treated individually. Teachers learn who you are. Your not just a number like you would be at a bigger university. Best staff all around. Amazing Christ living school!
If you're looking for a small school, ODU is a great choice. The small class sizes give you plenty of opportunities to create relationships with the professors. Very friendly staff and helpful advisors. It can be rough making friends as a commuter if you don't join clubs though--but they have ample amount of clubs. ODU is an amazing small college.
I spent three years working my tail off to graduate early and now that it's time to leave... I wish I had taken that additional year. Ohio Dominican is an unrecognized gem of a campus in Columbus, Ohio. It's perfect for students who need or want a small campus and its central location makes doing activities on evenings and weekends enjoyable.
Very small but very great! so many opportunities for you to excel! I wouldn't want to go anywhere else because other universities won't have a science department like they do. also they have good finical aid

Though the campus is close to the heart of the city, the surrounding area is not the best. The professors for the most part are good (if you know who you are taking) and the students are kind and fun to be around. Sports are big here. The school could use an update and some buildings are better than others. I'm content. Could be better.
Eh, it's not an area you want to be in at sundown.  Library is a decent place to work at. I guess there are opportunities if you really look for them and want them bad enough.  The grounds doesn't really stand out unless there's a pep rally or something like that.  Best part of the grounds is the Mary statue.  Internet is spotty.  Decent school
A little expensive if you don't come on a scholarship. Place is not in a great neighborhood and the security and tech department leave a lot to be desired. Work load can be a lot but that's why they have tutors and teachers have office hours. Food isn't fit for a horse. The good think about this place is the Spanish tutor and writing lab.
1st semester here and I feel quite at home,  the work load is pretty heavy but im a Mother of 3 so I knew after receiving my AA that this would be even more challenging so here I am. Did I mention their cafe is all you can eat heaven.  #SkinnyFatGirl lol. Advisors are the best also.  Great choice Soooooo far
Great school, love the small campus. Some professors are amazing, others aren't so great. I wish there was a collage that was mother/ father friendly. They give no exceptions to mothers/ fathers. They have one set of rules on attendance, regardless of your situation.  Not fair because mothers/ father need to take care of their kids when their sick.
ODU has its ups and downs  but the faculty are the best part !

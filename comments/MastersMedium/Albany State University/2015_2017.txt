Albany State University is amazing. You learn to love it!
Not the perfect school for a social,outgoing individual
I
dab
I love the family atmosphere it bring
The staff & faculty wants you to actually learn to understand so that was positive. However , the school is in the middle of nowhere and some students are mean and not friendly. Therefore the atmosphere is mostly cliques and if you not in a clique then you have no friends.
I love my HBCU. You have great opportunities and great people on campus to interact with. I am forever a golden ram.
The communication at this school is awful. I get no response when I call or email someone and it's only my first semester here. Considering transferring already.
Good school�� not that bad
Its Decent. Theres Nothing Really Out Here In Albany. The Classes Are Okay. The Dorms Are Old. The Food Is Okay. Chick fil a Hasnt Opened Up Yet.
Its the only thing in albany ga besides there little mall. Very Country..... There aren't really activities besides frats and sororities. The food is okay. not bad but isn't always good. pizza hut here is slow asf, the subway is slow too, starbucks has rude employees. The financial aid office is super slow so make sure your be outside 1hr before

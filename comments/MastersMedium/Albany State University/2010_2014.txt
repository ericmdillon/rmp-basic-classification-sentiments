Albany State University is an alright school. I haven't had too many problems and I have met a who lot of people here. I don't like that there isn't much to do outside of the campus and their isn't alos of school pride but overall it is alright!!
I love ASU! This university has great school spirit and is well supported by its community. Things can always be better like other universities but overral this school is a great example of a family.
*Pretty good school *very hot climate in the summer *lots & lots of gnats and flies  *hbcu *nice teachers that are fairly helpful  *best homecomings!!!
School is a ery good campus and growing in size and enrollment every year.
It's a great institution. The students are incredibly nice, you may not even know them and they'll greet you while walking throughout campus. Professors actually care about your education and go out there way to help you! There's also interesting events on campus to attend.The food is the only negative thing I have to say.
The institution is very well-rounded as a whole
has its ups and down like any other
My department made my ASU experience great I love HPER
I Love My HBCU
Very social school & its easy to meet new people. But dont get caught up in all of the partying because its alot of that going. The teachers also really want you to be great in what you do.
Its alright. The staff could care less if you make it or not. If they had better staff,professors and better food it would be a good school.
Functionality of  student services needs drastic improvement. Some professors need to be more helpful to students.

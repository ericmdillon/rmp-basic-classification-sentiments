This School is geared toward working adults- specifically those of us in the workforce who have to return to school to advance. Anyone looking for the typical undergraduate experience, look elsewhere! The programs here are good, reputable and flexible, most importantly they are ABET accredited and affordable.
I transferred to TESU with 114 credits. This is the only reason I picked this school. It's cheap, fast, and had a liberal transfer policy. I'm graduating with a BALS Social Science & ASNSM Computer Science in June 2021. Didn't learn anything new. If you just need a degree to check the box I'd recommend it. Accepted to a different graduate school.
TESU is a decent choice for adult learners possessing some college credits and professional/life experience to complete degrees online. Be sure to use their liberal transfer credit acceptance policy; they will grant credit for just about anything, with few limits, as long as they are assured that the work was college-level and completed by you.

The career center is good, they helped me find an internship.
This school is very underwhelming. It's like they only care about students that are either going to work for the school or athletes. The organizations aren't that interesting, the campus is extremely dry, and they see us students as dollar signs. The worst part is, is that they raised the tuition while in the middle of this pandemic.
Have to park far from the campus. Half the time shuttle buses don't operate, have to walk a long way to get to the campus.
I think its ridiculous I pay full price for virtual classes with no professor. No nothing. No heat. No AC. No classroom. No usage of anything. Why are we paying the same as if I had a professor. No questions. No interaction. Nothing. Its terrible.
If you drive there you have to pay $8 a day to park your car. That's a lot just to park on campus.
Its cute but not somewhere super important but it is small and teachers remember your name which I like. The honors and law programs are good and the business school is BEAUTIFUL! Great school to go to for business.

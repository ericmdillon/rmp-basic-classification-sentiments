There are so many things to do on the Lasell campus. There is never a dull moment. The food in the dining hall is great and the faculty and staff are amazing. The professors here want to see you understand the material rather than memorize stuff from a textbook.
Lasell is a great place to get involved in lots of activities on campus, go into Boston, and go to sports games. There is a lot of opportunity on campus with internships, hands-on learning, etc. Lasell is a great community in a great location to be apart of.
small school. you can go into boston if you want to get off campus. everyone knows everything about everyone. food is not that great
Lasell has given me so many opperunities. There are so many things on campus. We are so close to Boston which gives students the ability to do something every night. They also host so many great events on campus as well. There is always something fun to do. The professors are also amazing. They are so friendly and helpful.

There can be limited parking and if you do find it, it will probably be far away from your class building. If you live on campus, basically everything you will need is within a 5-7 minute walk away.
Rhode Island college They did a pretty good job, transitioning the majority of classes to a/synchronized remote learning. Everyone managed to come together rather well.
RIC is the greatest school! I love it here!
The professors consistently cancel class mere minutes before class starts, 100% disrespectful to commuters coming from other parts of the start 30+ minutes away. Professors have extremely conflicting expectations of students, some lack any & all compassion for those who are injured and struggle to be mobile. Worst experience ever. Not going back!
If you're tight on money RIC is definitely the best route you can take if you qualify for in-state tuition. There are some drawbacks to this though, as this school is primarily a commuter school so don't expect the traditional college experience (URI is where you'd find that). If you just want your degree and nothing else, RIC is a great choice.
This college is not the best. The records office and the student enrollment center never answer the phone or emails. So many professors are senile, racist, and downright rude to students
better then the expectations !
The school is no help when it comes to the education department. It will take five years to get a bachelor's degree where you get zero financial aid for the fifth year. The first thing my academic advisor told me to give up the idea of graduating in four year. Completely regret going here and wish I transferred after my first year.
Good environment

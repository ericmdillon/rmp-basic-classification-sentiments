This university has undertaken an aggressive PR campaign requesting millions of dollars to close the "equity gap". Yet, when I recently contacted an attorney, he noted the firm currently has several other suits pending against MSU. Administration of both course material and policy is so poor- I'm surprised they meet accreditation standards.
Metro is a great school with a lot of opportunities. 10/10 recommend.
Great school just sucks that it is such a large campus.
I personally have never stepped foot on the campus. From what others have told me, they like it. The teachers are a mixed bag, id say 50/50 of good and bad teachers. The worst experience I have had with the school is student aid. I must've accumulated weeks talking with them. Takes forever to respond, 4 hour phone lines, and lots of mistakes.
MSU is a well respected school with a lot of great professors and unique options for classes. I plan on staying all 4 years, but the location could be better. Lots of homeless, oh and once someone attacked someone at the light rail station on Colfax with a Hatchet but honestly I do recommend going here, they do a good job with security.
Great, diverse campus with teachers who care.
MSU Denver (5stars) provides students with excellent opportunities & networking! Professors provide good instruction & follow-through! This is not a party school, it's for serious students desiring a high quality ed. at a reasonable cost. MSU's Pres. Janine Davidson is at the helm & enough words can't describe her teams amazing leadership!
Advisors are practically non-existing. You have to figure everything on your own otherwise you are in big trouble, do not rely on advisors to be there for you. They absolutely do not care about you or your educational needs and will screw you over. It's really hard to get ahold of someone that cares to listen. (aside from professors)

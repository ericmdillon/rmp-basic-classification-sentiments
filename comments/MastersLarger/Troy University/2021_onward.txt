Great school!
Absolutely love it here! If you are thinking about coming to Troy please do! The people and the beautiful campus really make Troy stand out.
The campus is nice. Not too big, not too small. Good education comparable to most public universities in the state (USA, UAB, UAH, Auburn, etc). I like the small town when going off campus, but there could be more activities available for college students. Movie theater, bowling, etc are 45 minutes away. Troy should have those. It's big enough.
I love Troy University! I'm to ASU for grad school, and Troy's administration is so much more organized. Troy is what you make it, the more you put in the more you will get out.
Great school
I would choose troy every time over and over again! I am attending their grad school after graduation.
Beautiful Campus, no cameras on campus only in buildings.
I have found that most people who attend Troy did not plan on coming to Troy. They say that Troy chooses you before you choose Troy. This place is like radiator springs: a really nice community curiously tucked in the middle of nowhere. They have lots of accreditations and lots of clubs, and the professors know the students really well.
For a small knit community, Troy University offers everything a college student can ask for. The university is not in the most ideal area, but it is what you make of it. Troy University requires you to get out of your comfort zone. From making new friends to getting involved with the numerous clubs and organizations Troy has to offer.
Troy University was such a let down for me. Came in and was so excited. Marching band was such an underwhelming experience for a group full of people who think they're all music geniuses. The school acts like there's school spirit, but nobody goes to anything unless free stuff is given out. Get the vibe that some profs don't even wanna be there.
I learned a lot from Troy.

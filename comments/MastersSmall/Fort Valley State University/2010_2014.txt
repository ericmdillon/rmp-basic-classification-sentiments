If you're not from the south, do not attend. You'd be better off at a school in Atlanta if you're really set on going down south.
this is a hbcu and is very different than most. its family oriented and if your head is not in school then you should not come here. most people think that this school is a party school. it is, but we get our work done first
It is a very good starter school, for those who can not easily transition over to college. I don't think it's good to graduate from. It has nice housing for freshman. I love the new student center and the gym.
If you make the choice to attend FVSU physically then you will likely enjoy your experience. The Professors are really good.  If you decide to attend as a Distance Learner, be prepared for issues with noncommunication, difficulty with Financial Aid and Registration.   Education may get a "B", but administration needs some improvement.
School is a dead zone nothing to do but party and the school could use a remodeling.
Overall not a bad school though do your research on what are of study you want to try before attending here
Great school to go to If you want to party a lot. Great school spirit and there are always events to attend on campus so there is never a dull moment. Overall a great school to attend for learning and having a great time during your college career.
Most of the staff is friendly but some of the professors are sorry. I'm not impressed over all and would like to go somewhere else but my options are limited.

GREAT place to go greek. I'm not saying pledge but if u already wanted to u will LOVE your time at FVSUan HBCU period. Lots of opportunities for smart students, especially CDEP kids. Lots of not smartmotivated students that do whatever 247. It's an okay place, has its proscons. Really inexpensive to get ur degree, and keep it moving.
Location is not good, campus is cute though.
My freshman year was great but now the school is depressingly boring.
I was a Math major and the professors were great! The location is remote so it is hard to get around if you don't have a car; there is also no local transportation. There are a wide choice of restaurants nearby. I was able to balance my social life with academics. It is a great stepping stone. The culture is great! #HBCU #NiceDorms #Math #BMMB
College is what you make it. There are lots of opportunities at FVSU but you won't find them if you stay in your dorm room all day.
6.5/10
The school is really nice and the campus is beautiful and the professors are cool

I loved Mount Union. I transferred my sophomore year from a larger University and don't regret it at all. The Professors are top notch. I had a ton of opportunities in my selected field and was setup for success after graduation. I do know that some departments are better than others (as with most schools) so do you research before you attend.
I loooove UMU!! everyone is extremely helpful!
I love mount! get involved and you will love it too! Greek life was my saving grace but there are so many other awesome clubs and teams that will help you feel at home too. I highly suggest going greek though ;)
Love Mount. Food is very average and I think the facilities are awesome. Great small-school atmosphere. Lots of parties that are fun and welcoming (if you make them fun, don't come expecting project X). Easy to make friends and lots of clubs to join. Lots of great professors but some trash ones as usual. Dr. Wuchter is the GOAT.
I love this place

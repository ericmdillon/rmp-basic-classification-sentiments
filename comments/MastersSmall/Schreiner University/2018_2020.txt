Schreiner is a very small school that feels more like a high school than a university. I'm transferring after one year here. If you want to feel like you're stuck in high school for another four years, then this is the place to go.
Love
Small university with little opportunity unless tou live on campus. Have many courses that only one professor teaches, which is bad. Some professors are smart, but take it to a condescending arrogance and wont be rationale with their teaching style. The students are still into catching pokemon, dungeons and dragons, and power rangers.
Great environment. Beautiful campus. I have been attending Schreiner since Fall 2016 and I still love it here. Overall, I would call a 4.3/5 for Schreiner. The food and internet connection are alright but are improving a bit. Most of the professors genuinely care for their students and want them to succeed and achieve their own goals.
I love it here!
This school is terrible
If you want to establish yourself as a professional, this is your place.
Great place to make lifelong friends while earning a degree
Schreiner University focuses on building a strong relationship between faculty and students. This means that there are amazing opportunities to be mentored and coached in whatever field of study you choose.
Beautiful Campus, a lot to do and is minutes away from the Guadalupe river.

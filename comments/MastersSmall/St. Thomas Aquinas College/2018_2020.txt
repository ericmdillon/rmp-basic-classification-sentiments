The campus is dead on the weekend. Most kids live close by so they go home on the weekends and then theres nothing to do. Campus safety is always writing kids up. The students are usually unintelligent and rude. Some teachers are good and really care though.
no
Boring Place, but hey it is what you make of it. I recommend people to join clubs and stay as active as possible. If your looking for a party school look in another direction, most people on campus leave on the weekends. Keep in mind this school is very small so be careful what you do, everyone talks. On the bright side the teachers are awesome
Will forever love STAC and the opportunities I was given. It is what you make of it and you should always make the best out of any school. I love how its so small and everyone knows each other.

I hated this damn school.
The class sizes are small which is very helpful in learning and teacher-student communication. The campus life is not a party school at all. The biology program is excellent and the professors in the biology program are excellent and always willing to help.
STAC was good when it came to my major. But when it came to everything else, including the people- it was a terrible decision and definitely not worth the tuition paid to attend and live there. I would advise most people to steer clear of STAC because of the tuition, the social interactions will be sub par I assure you. Save your money.
STAC is a great college, the professor are always at the students disposition, and no student really has a reason to fail because of all the resources. as far as the campus goes and the social life.. if your looking for a party school this isn't it.
nahh
STAC is an amazing college. The science professor at Stac are so motivating, inspiring and friendly. The individual attention provided to each student makes the learning and teaching experience between the professor and students even stronger. I love STAC!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you want to get an education this is the best school. If you want a party campus it's not the school for you.
STAC like any college is what you make of it. I was involved a lot of clubs while at STAC and had the best time. It is NOT a huge party school so if thats what you are looking for in a college, STAC isn't for you but there are parties...you just need to be proactive. The people who say they hate STAC, were the ones who no one ever saw on campus.
If you become friends with the right people and you make the best of your time here instead of complaining, you'll have the time of your life.

Great school. Glad I ended up here. Some changes to the dining would be beneficial.
No football team. Nothing much to do, the dorms suck and you're forced to stay in them for 2 years soon to be 3 years. Overall its way too strict, they try to control you too much for you to have any fun without paying for it.
School sucks. The school has professors who change their words after making promises to the student. There is no place for the student to confront or notify the school of the issues. Even after emailing the school about such power-driven problems from professors, there are no changes done.
I'd rather eat the dirt outside the dining hall than the food inside. Might as well find a spot on the ground to avoid sitting on the broken chairs. The earth here is crying because there ain't no recycling (or trash cans). Good dorm life and safety is not a concern. Overall it is a good university.
I really enjoy all of the profs here.

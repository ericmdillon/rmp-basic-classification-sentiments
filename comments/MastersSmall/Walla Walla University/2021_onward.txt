WWU is a good university, but COVID has really made the cafeteria worse and clubs and social life have suffered. Hopefully things will go back to normal soon.
WWU is a decent place.
WWU has a nice community that is well church-supported, but lacks clean and modern facilities as well as food is WAY overpriced and not good.
Walla gets the job done especially if you have good scholarships, Id say it is worth it.
its a pretty good school
caf food could always be better. terrible options for vegan/gluten free and they make you purchase a meal plan if you live in the dorm, and they make you live in the dorm for about 3 years. deans are kind of ok but never respond to emails.

Not a great location. Parking is horrible, would have to get here at 7:30AM just to find a spot for a class that started at 10:00AM. Half the time my phone wouldn't connect to their wifi or was too slow. Not a lot of clubs or things to do compared to Morgantown. Food here gave my friends food poisoning several times. Covered in oil and undercooked.
Great school with really great people. The atmosphere and education is great.
I haven't been here long yet I must say my experience here has been pretty meh. Everything is just passable. This school is mostly inoffensive but there are times I wish I went somewhere else. The professors are for the most part great, at least from my experience so far. The dorms badly need remodeled. They're also not generous with scholarships.
I started here and left to go to WVU bc I thought that was my dream school. I got to WVU and found you are more of a number and things just arent taught in your courses. WVU wouldnt let me into my major. I transferred back and was accepted instantly and my first semester back made straight As. FSU has more caring staff and better resources.
This is a small school with a large population of commuters. Find a group freshman year or it'll be too late. There is no hype around any sports teams (so never a student section). This school is not for anyone who wants a typical college experience. Only 2 restaurants on campus. Buildings are run down, especially dorms. Go to WVU.

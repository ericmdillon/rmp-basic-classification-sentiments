LIU - nursing has a bad vibe because of the professors that are disrespectful of the students. They believe they are untouchable and can do what ever they want. It would be time to hire new professors that would care about their adult responsible students. We should be valued as we are the future of nursing. Very poor level. Regretting my choice.
It's basically known for Nursing or Pharmacy, and that tuition is no joke. The school looks old and all, but to be honest it's a landmark. They need to hire new professors and especially new staff members in enrollment services and advisors. They don't care nor pick up the phone and don't wanna help. They literally tell you 'I don't know" SMH
I still have a year left as of making this review, but I feel like I need to say this to students who are planning to enroll into LIU Brooklyn. Always expect something to go wrong. 3/4 years and for 6 semesters Ive had classes getting dropped a weeks or even a week before the semester starts, and I would have a very hard time finding courses
The school academics is great, professors could be better but overall education wise its amazing, social life this campus is very small if you live on campus everyone is in your business. The food in their cyber cafe is amazing but the actual cafeteria could be better. The school is great for my nursing and pharmacy majors definitely look it.
